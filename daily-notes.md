1. `art route:list` => lists all routes in my app.
2. `|` => called "pipe". In terminal takes output of command to the left and passes it to command ot the right.
3. `grep "verify"` => Search function in terminal.
4. Conclusion(1,2,3) `art route:list | grep "verify"`
5. If I'm searching for which controller, view, etc a route leads to I can
   use `art route:list | grep "route-i-am-searching-for"`
6. touch => terminal command that creates a file. example: `touch daily-notes.md `
7. `npm run` =>  I can see the available options in package.json "scripts".
8. `asset` => 'assets' is for .js, .css, html, pictures etc and are always saved inside public/assets. When I
   see `asset('build/assets/app.60fef7bc.css')` inside a file i have in my mind that is inside public directory.
9. Servers run PHP, python, node.js.
10. Client run css, js, html.
11. Hot Module Replacement( or Hot Reloading) => allows you to refresh the page when a piece of JavaScript is changed
    and also maintain the current state of the component in the browser.
12. Documentation -> have to make micro assumptions, so I can guess where the answer is located.
